* (13-Nov-2007) What is new in Tol-1.1.6:

Bugs Fixed

Below we provide three lists of bugs grouped by their different state of resolution:
    * List of 45 bugs resolved and fixed during the development cycle.
    * List of 10 bugs that we know about, and are currently working on.
    * List of 19 bugs postponed for a later resolution.
More details in http://bugs.tol-project.org.

Outstanding Internal Changes

Following is a list of outstanding internal changes applied in the core implementation which provide more reliability and efficiency, and around 25% to 50% of performance improvement in respect with the previous release. Read more.

    * Symbol Table implementation replaced in favor of the Google hash_map.
    * Improved memory allocation for small Tol objects.
    * Simplified Real type implementation to facilitate the integration with external libraries such as GSL and BLAS.
    * Improved initialization process.
    * Some memory leaks have been fixed.

Kernel

    * When the result of evaluating an If/Case condition is an unknown value, the evaluation is stopped and the unknown value corresponding with the data type of the expression is returned.
    * Parse function now gives back information about parenthesis used in the original expression, to facilitate the work of Unparse.
    * Text Grammar(Anything) function returns "Struct" when an structured Set object is used as a parameter.
    * A new structured type called NameBlock 

StdLib

The so called Tol Init Library has been substituted by the Standard Library. The latter includes the former to provide full backward compatibility. It will be reorganized using NameBlocks to reach a new level of maturity and abstraction, providing modularity advantages as well.

StdLib includes:

    * Bayesian estimation for linear models, probit models, and vector ARIMA. All them with hierarchical inputs, a priori information, and linear constraints.
    * Stronger AIA than the one provided built-in with Tol.
    * New function CheckTOLRelease verifies whether a new release is available.
    * New functions such as HasUnknown, HasPosInf, HasNegInf, HasAllFinite, CheckBST, CheckBDT, CheckBMT, IncludeLocalTol, PlainNamedObjects, etc.

Set Algebra

    * New function Set Append(Set old, Set newElements) to incorporate elements in a set using a more efficient way than: Set old := old << newElements
    * New function Set EvalSetOfCode(Set funciones, Anything arg) that returns a Set with all results given back from each function belonging to the first parameter (Set functions) and executed with the common arguments given in the second parameter (Anything arg).
    * New syntax operator :: to access members of a Set, as a cleaner approach for accessing elements, instead of using angle brackets [""] as it was mandatory until this release.
    * New function Real SetIndexByName(Set s) to index every element of a Set, reducing the complexity of accessing them. It is based on the Google hash_map.

Real Arithmetic

    * New functions Real IsPosInf(Real x), Real IsNegInf(Real x), Real IsFinite(Real x)
    * New behavior when comparing unknown and infinite values:
      Any given number or unknown value can not be greater than +infinite, what let us to say:

      ? > +Inf == false;
      ? <= +Inf == true;
      Any given number or unknown value can not be less than -infinite, what let us to say:

      ? < -Inf == false;
      ? >= -Inf == true; 

Real Linear Algebra

    * New functions PreProdDiag and PostProdDiag to compute the virtual product of diagonal matrices.
    * New functions SubTriang and SetTriang to provide an optimized store for triangular matrices.
    * New function TrSolve based on dtrsm BLAS function (level-3), for the efficient resolution of triangular systems.
    * New functions Matrix Sign(Matrix m), Matrix SetSum(Set s), Real MatMin(Matrix m), Real MatMax(Matrix m)
    * A new warning messages will be shown when Choleski is not working.

Interpolation and Real Functions Approaching

New APIs have been implemented into Tol for the use of interpolation and real functions approaching.

    * Tol uses GSL functions for performing interpolation in combination with scalar and vectorial generation functions, gsl_interp and gsl_vector_interp.
    * Tol uses AlgLib functions for interpolation and approximatio. AlgLib is more efficient than GSL and let us to save all needed information with OIS, through functions AlgLib.Interp.Vector.CreateWorkSpace and AlgLib.Interp.Vector.LoadWorkSpace.

Statistical and Probability Functions

    * R2, Pearson, and Partial Correlation statistics has been fixed.
    * New function UniKerDnsEstOptBnw, abbreviation of Univariate Kernel Density Estimation with Optimal Bandwith, a program developed by Vikas C. Raykar under the terms of LGPL license and publicly available.
    * New function RandMultinomial based on GSL function gsl_ran_multinomial.
    * Deep improvements in behavior, variety of parameters and documentation of function GibbsConstrainedMNorm.

Input/output

Database Access

        * Several bugs fixed related with numerical data types.
        * MYSQL_TYPE_NEWDECIMAL is available for MySQL instances >= 50024.

Files

        * Data file formats BDT and BST now support longer lines. In older versions it was able to have 16384 characters per line, but now it accepts 1048576 line characters. If there was longer lines a warning message will be displayed to notice the problem and let the user fix it.
        * BMT Matrices can hold unknown values in their cells, and varia ble length text.
        * New function MatAppendFile for inserting rows in a Matrix, in the binary format BBM.
        * New function MatReadCell to get the content of a Matrix cell in the binary format BBM.

OIS

        * OIS modules images with referential integrity already saves information about the source file of each object visible in Tolbase.
        * Symbols with no conflict will be available in global scopes, although this is could lead our application to an unpredictible behavior. It is recommended to load images in local scopes as far as it was possible.
        * Switched off several warning messages relevant only for debugging
          porposes.
        * If there is a system environment variable called Ois.DefRoot, the so called Tol variable will take its value from there, to facilitate and customize each configuration case.



* (22-Fab-2007) What is new in Tol-1.1.5:

Database Access

Tol Database Access is made of three components: the Tol-Database Functions API, the Tol-Database Connector, and the Tol-Database Drivers. In this very new release two of those components have been almost new implemented, the Connector and the Drivers.

The Connector has a new improved implementation that ensures a more reliable connection. Apart from that, now the connector will give back the users messages coming from the DBRMS, messages related with operations the DBRMS are leading with.

A new direct driver has been implemented to connect to PostgreSQL, and also the driver to connect with MySQL DBRMS has been improved. If your projects retrieve data from MySQL or PostgreSQL we really encourage you to use these new direct drivers instead of the slower ODBC-Tol driver, that has been also reviewed and fixed.

See examples in TOL tests DB
OIS

The largest change in Tol 1.1.5 is OIS. OIS stands for Object Index and Serialization. It is a powerful subsystem that provides a way to save live objects and giving them back to live in another session, even on different computers. OIS was mainly developed during second half of 2006 and enough tested during this last development cycle.

This official release comes with a new OIS feature, Tol Data and Source Storage Method, that includes the following properties:

    * Handle TOL Source Modules with reference integrity for fast library loading
    * InitLibrary has been converted to an OIS module.
    * Storing and loading data in OIS images, with or without reference integrity
    * Warning message for BSI and BMM deprecated due to these files should be replaced by OIS images. 

You can follow next links to watch an OIS introduction (PPT) and to read the OIS User Manual

See examples the in TOL tests CVS project.
Kernel

Implemented a new Memory Pool Manager called "Bayes Fixed Size Memory". A longer description around is available in FSMEM.odt (document based on ODF standard document format).

With this new Memory Manager Tol improves the handle of massive little objects, doing it faster and more controlled way. It is a transparent feature for Tol users, and brings these visible advantages:

    * Ensure that an object is alive before handle it in the local stack.
    * Avoid memory leaks related to local dating of a time serie in circumstances like detected in bugs 224, 428, 444, 456.
    * Enhanced security of BText methods. 

Boolean Algebra

A new implementation of internal boolean algebra.
See examples in TOL tests

    * Handling with unknowns:
      And(?,0) -> false
      Or(?,1) -> true
    * Allowing short-circuit calculations:
          o When If expression is unknown no branch (then nor else ones) will be evaluated.
          o When a condition of Case is unknown its branch will be not evaluated.
          o Fisrt false argument in And stops evaluation and returns false (this feature has been temporaly disabled).
          o First true argument in Or stops evaluation and returns true (this feature has been temporaly disabled).
          o Fisrt non matching comparisson of functions LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT stops evaluation and returns false (this feature has been temporaly disabled). 

Statistics and Probability functions

Implemented a new method of AIA (Automatic analysis of Intervention of temporary series). To know more about this feature write in a terminal screen:
tol -v -c"WriteLn(Description(AIA))"

And visit related TOL tests.
Data Mining

A new built-in function called Cluster has been imported to Tol for the hierarchic vectors classification. It is based on the open source library called The C Clustering Library.

Other methods like k-means, Self-Organizing Maps, and Main Component Analysis could be incorporated. To see a description executes in a terminal screen:
tol -v -c"WriteLn(Description(Cluster))"
TOLSH

Is a new Tol feature that brings Tcl code execution to the Tol Console, based on the Toltcl library.




* (11-Nov-2006) What is new in Tol-1.1.4:

          o Syntax tree tokens detects constant literals (numbers, strings and dates)
          o Syntax tree tokens store references to undeletable system objects (type names, built-in functions, ...)
          o New local stack structure with a super fast dictionary tree with cost O(1) in RAM and CPU 
    * Allowing use of a local Struct.
      See examples in test of bug 246
    * Integrity of system constants: no longer the constant system objects will be modified. When an assignation of a constant is a done, an internal copy of the object is created so no unexpected collateral effect will take place.
      See examples in Tol tests (under construction)
    * By value pass of objects for builder operator (=), but on type Set.
      See examples in TOL tests CreationAndCopy
    * User Tol objects now have Description and Expression like separated functions, but only the description is modifiable by the user whereas the expression will only fill up Tol when the variable Real DoUnparseNodes is certain. When there is no description, user will receive the expression if exists, or the empty string. The Identify function returns the first non empty text of the list Name(), LocalName(), Expression(), Description() 

Tol-Tester

Creation of TOL-Tester: An automatic Tests Control System for Tol versions. The Tol-Tester project ensures a sane behavior of Tol implementation Code during the development cycle.
Read this notes for further information.
System

    * New optional argument to control waiting mode in TOL built-in function WinSystem(Text command, Real showMode [, Real wait=FALSE])
    * New InitLibrary functions for calling operative system in a multiplattform API.
      See the code available at general/_system.tol 

Messages

    * Enable extended type messages in Write and WriteLn with an optional argument and new user functions Error and Warning in InitLibrary.
    * Best verbosity/mute handling in command line Tol Console.
      To know more about this feature write in your console
      tol -help
    * Functions that returns Anything can returns no object without send any error message and can be used in any scope.
    * Standard TOL log file start .log is moved to %APPDATA%\to\syslog in windows and ~/.tol in linux
    * New function PutLanguage to set the current human language of TOL messages
    * Each message of error or warning will adjoin a correlative number so that the user can find more easily first of them and follow the track more comfortably to them.
    * The Real variables TOL NError and Real NWarning have been created in order to return the number of errors and warnings emitted until the moment in the session, so that the users can verify in run time if a process is working correctly. 

Matrix Type

New functions of matrices have been implemented:

    * The built-in TOL functions of Matrix type f01, F01 and Inv01 implement the density, the distribution and its inverse for variates with uncorrelated standard multinormal distribution.
    * The operators of matrices (+, -, *) now admit like second element as much a matrix as a real number. 

See examples in TOL tests (under construction)
TimeSet Type

A deep enhancement of TimeSet Algebra implementation using concepts described here.

New advantages are:

    * Almost all bugs reported about TimeSet has been solved.
    * Faster methods for almost all successor an predecessor methods.
    * Enhanced cache methods.
    * Auto-abortable calculations in empty and bounded TimeSet's to avoid infinite cycles (a warning will be sent).
    * The begin is set to 1582-12-31 (Gregorian calendar begins at 1582-10-15) 

See examples in TOL tests TimeSetCoherence
Serie Type

    * BDT series are no more lazy to avoid some collateral problems.
    * New built-in Tol function Serie EvalSerie(Serie S, Code realToRealFunction) 

Text Type

    * Enhancement of some functions: BeginWith, EndAt, Reverse.
    * New system information objects TOLSessionPath and TOLVersion 

Statistics and Probability functions

    * Enhancement of unknown treatment in distribution functions.
    * New faster methods for truncated normal distribution:
          o Scalar: DensMultiNormalTrunc, DensTruncatedNormal, DistTruncatedNormal, DistTruncatedNormalInv, DrawTruncatedNormal
          o Vectorial: RandTruncatedMultNormal, LogDensTruncatedMultNormal 
    * New methods Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for the sampling of implicitly defined probability distributions using built-in functions GibbsSampler and MetropolisHastings.
      To know more about this feature write in your terminal screen:
      tol -vU -c"WriteLn(Description(GibbsSampler))" \
      -c"WriteLn(Description(MetropolisHastings))"
    * Solving bugs in definition, naming and using of R2, Pearson, Correlation and other statistics
    * New package of TOL built-in functions to allow TOL users to work with GSL functions which both returning and arguments are all of numeric type.
      Read more here
    * Enhancements in function Estimate (Max. Likelihood ARIMA models estimator):
          o When a step gives worst result than previous iteration estimation of missing values must remains unchanged.
          o An error will be emited if an input hasn't InputDef structure.
          o In the ARMAAutoCovarianzeVector function used internally by Estimate there was an invalid access of memory when there is no part AR in a model and a smaller number of autocovarianzas is asked for or just as degree MA, which could give rise to falls or strange behaviors of random and irreproducible form. 

          
          
* (16-Feb-2005) What is new in Tol-1.1.3:

** New user function to generate a markov chain for a truncated multivariate
   normal, the truncation region given by a set of linear constraints Bx <=
   b. The functions are:

	GibbsConstrainedMNormal -- to obtain the whole chain.
	
	RandConstrainedMNormal -- to obtain only the last sample in the
	chain.

** User function RandIChisq now accept a scale parameter in order to simulate
   a scaled inversed chi-squared.

** New Tol feature: User Functions Overloading.

   Now Tol let us create more than one function with the same name, but
   returning different data types. What does this new feature mean?

   We can write code like this below:
     ____________________________
     Real func (Real param) { param };
     Text func (Text param) { param };
     Real a = func(12);
     Text b = func("It Works!");

   After execute it, both variables, "Real a" and "Text b", has their own
   respective values. In both of these sentences, Tol can get the Type involved
   in the operation, reading the Left-side sentence. But sometimes, when we
   give a User Function as an argument for another function, Tol can not
   recognise which is the Tol Type associated with the overloaded function we
   need. In those cases Tol returns the first function encountered. 

   Next example shows that particular case:
     _______________________________________________________________________
     Set  getNameSP(Text vorname, Text name) { SetOfAnything(vorname, name) };
     Set  getNameUK(Text vorname, Text name) { SetOfAnything(name, vorname) };
     Text getNameSP(Text vorname, Text name) { vorname + " " + name };
     Text getNameUK(Text vorname, Text name) { name + ", " + vorname };
     Text names(Text vorname, Text name, Code fun) { fun(vorname, name) };

     Text aText = names("Peter", "Jackson", Text getNameSP);

   There are 5 functions. Two of them called "getNameSP" returning a Set and a
   Text. Other two more called "getNameUK" returning also a Set and a
   Text. And the last of them called "names" and returning a Text. This last
   one receive a Code as one of their arguments.
   Then function "names" is called using  "Text getNameSP" as its 3th
   argument. If this argument was given without a particular type, Tol will
   try to get the first function created that was called "getNameSP", that
   would be "Set getNameSP" function.

   Other example of use of this new feature is the possibility to create a
   User Function with the same name as a Built-In function:

     _____________________________________________________
     Set DensCauchy(Set s) 
       { Set EvalSet(s, Real (Real e) { DensCauchy(e) }) };

     Set sIn = SetOfReal(1,2,3,4);
     Set sOut = DensCauchy(sIn);
   
   DensCauchy is a Built-In Real Type function, but in this example we have
   created a User Function called also DensCauchy. We can create a new User
   Function called as other one, always that the new one returns something
   different than the old one.

** MakeGlobal changes.
   
   MakeGlobal function let us export more than one local variable to the
   global scope, and in every place of the local code. Until now we can export
   only one local variable and it must be related with the result
   returned. Now we can execute code like this:
   _______________________
   Real func(Real param) {
     Real locvar1 = 10;
     MakeGloba(locvar1);  // exporting to global scope
     Real locvar2 = 20;   // exporting to global scope
     MakeGlobal(locvar2);
     param
   };	    
   Real x = 1;
   Real y = func(x);
   Real a = locvar1;  // now, after func call, locvar1 is global
   Real b = locvar2;  // now, after func call, locvar2 is global

** Dynamic Scope avaliable at compile time.

   Like many common languages, Tol uses a Lexical implementation of the
   Scope. But at the beginning, Tol had another implementation: a Dynamic
   Scope, meaning that a code like this:
     _______________________________
     Real r = 4;
     Real fun(Real q) {q+r};
     Real b = { Real r = 1; fun(8) };

   Assigns 9 to variable "b".

   A Dynamic Scope means that each time Tol needs a variable, looks for it
   into the calls stack.
   To enable Dynamic Scope you must compile Tol with --enable-DS (under
   Linux/Unix) or defining a macro called __USE_DYNSCOPE__ in compile time.

** External compilation of TOL DB Access using --enable-dbdrivers

   New configure option --enable-dbdrivers force Tol to be compiled with
   support for direct access to databases. In order to acomplish this we can
   specify several configure command line options. If you don't give such
   options, configure looks for the sources and libraries that needs to build
   Tol properly with DB Direct Access Support. 
   Check INSTALL file to know which options command line options are related
   with this new feature.

** Fixed bugs: 165, 171, 184, 191, 192, 194, 197, 199, 205, 214, 215, 216,
   218, 219, 223, 225, 226, 227, 229, 230, 233, 237, 240, 246, 247, 249

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* What is new in Tol-1.1.2:

** Tol is much more stable now than few months ago. We have resolved more than
   100 bugs since the first version, but Tol is still an unstable
   product, for many reasons. One of them is related with the Documentation
   Project, we are still without manuals, tutorials, technical
   reports...
   On the other side, Tol continues having some implementation problems with
   itsinternal modules, which are blocking all possibilities to release an
   stable product before their correction.
   Among the new features list for this version, we can emphasize:

** TIT: Tol Integrity Tests
   In the main directory yoo can see a new file called test-it.tol. Running
   this program you can start a global language consistency test across the
   directory tree. The program looks for "test" directories where we are
   adding individual tests to verify specific features of Tol.

** The Evalutor
   It does not allow creating variables using an identifier allready used by
   other variable of a different type.
   A great number of corrections have been applied to the Evaluation Engine.

** The Parser
   Improves its behavior with a better recognition of comments inside code,
   giving more complete information about the places where syntactical errors
   are.On the other side, the maximal identifier length has been limited to
   255.

** Random Number Generation
   Random and distributed number generator has been added, based on:
    * Cauchy  (RandCaucy)
    * LogNormal (RandLogNormal)

** Tcl_Eval implemented, as taken from the function description

	Set Tcl_Eval(Text script)

	Evaluate a Tcl script. The return value is a Set with two elements
	    status : a Real indicating success (1) or fail (0)
	    result : a Text with the evaluation result
	Example:

	    Set tcl_res = Tcl_Eval("set tcl_platform(platform)");
	    If (tcl_res["status"], WriteLn("Running on platform
	    "+tcl_res["result"]), WriteLn("Error in Tcl_Eval"))

** Database access
   TOL DDBB API has been re-programmed to open up the possibility of using
   multiple native drivers. At the same time, ODBC and MySQL drivers have been
   developed. Of course, no changes have been made to the TOL DB API, and
   a big change: Dynamic libraries saves some memory if a driver is not used.

** There are many little changes that we can't list here. Nevertheless we can
   give the URL of TOL Bug Report System (based on Bugzilla) to track all bugs
   which have been resolved:
   http://bugs.tol-project.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&resolution=FIXED

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* What was new in Tol-1.1.1:

** New estimation engine:
  -Maximum likelihood estimation of ARIMA models
  -Non linear least squares method improvement

** New user function QRDecomposition to implement QR decomposition of a
   matrix.

** New random generators from distributions:
   -RandChisq : random variate from a xi-squared distribution with n degree of
    freedom.
   -RandIChisq : random variate from an inverse xi-squared distribution with n
    degree of freedom.
   -RandGamma : random variate from a gamma distribution with parameters a and
    b.

** Changed version numbers to unify all packages: Tol, Toltcl and Tolbase

** Bugs fixed:
  -BMTFile(Set) (http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2)
  -CholeskiInverse (http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3)
  -QuantileS (http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4)

  -Timing traces (http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15)
  -If sentence (http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18)


* What was new in Tol-0.1.9:

** Changed project structure in order to put under gnu autoconf utilities
Now support autoconf shell script "configure" to build the library

** tol library become a new Open Source project under gnu/GPL license terms.
TOL was an internal project developed from 1995 at Bayes Decisión, SA 
(Spain, Madrid). Is the base software used with TOLBase, another open source
project. TOLBase is a user interface written in tcl/tk for programming in tol.
