	* generic/tolaccess.cpp: previous change does not handled
	correctly the expression:

	   Real a = 1;
	   Real a := a + 1;

	Related to bug 483. Objects are removed from stack in reverse
	order. It is the same way as BSet::Delete().
	
2006-01-31 Jorge <josp@tol-project.org>
	* generic/tolaccess.cpp: tol::console stack release now release
	only those objects having NREFS <= 1. Related to bug report

	* generic/toltcl.c

	-hidden is present the variables created are protected from being
	released by 'tol::console stack release'

	* configure.in: setting version to 1.1.5
	* toltcl.h: checking for macro PACKAGE_VERSION (set by TEA)
	* toltcl.c: 
	
2006-11-05 Jorge <josp@tol-project.org>
	* configure.in: TOL_LIB_DIR is hard-code into libtoltcl,
	implementing --enable-OIS because headers <tol/...> need that macro
	defined. When __USE_OIS__ be removed this option will not be
	needed any more
	
2006-11-03 Jorge <josp@tol-project.org>
	* tolaccess.cpp: Tol_GetReference (tolaccess.cpp:873), items was
	allocated with insuficient memory!
	* toltclInt.cpp: overloaded Tol_FindSet in order to return also if
	the Set found is a SetFromFile.

	* toltime.cpp:
	
2006-02-10  Víctor <vdebuen@tol-project.org>
	* generic/tolaccess.cpp: Ambiguous term ParentPath to refer the TOL file (.tol, .bdt, ...) where an object was created  is replaced by SourcePath and the asociated BSetFromFile* Parent is replaced by Source

2005-12-26 Jorge <josp@tol-project.org>
	* generic/toltableset.c : obtaining the name of columns from the
	names of the elements of the first row.
	
2005-10-25 Jorge <josp@tol-project.org>
	* generic/tolaccess.cpp : Tol_GetSetPath considers first name as a
	file name in order to detect names with spaces. Related to
	TOLBug-311.
	
2005-10-25 Antonio Zamorano <azamorano@tol-project.org>

	* generic/tolaccess.cpp:
	* generic/tolsergrp.cpp:
	* generic/toltclInt.cpp: now variables names are looked for also
	in the stack. This is particulary useful when invoking Tcl_Eval
	from TOL code.
2004-10-18  Jorge S. Pérez <josp@tol-project.org>

	* win/toltcl.dsp: the options must be set also for Debug version

	* generic/tolaccess.cpp:
	Fix Bug 20 -> http://bugs.tol-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20

	Each Tol Type shows information for each function (also operators) with the
	format they should be used.

	For example:
	  Operator Real &, before changes -> Real &(Real x1, Real x2)
	  Operator Real &, after changes ->  x1 & x2 {Real x1, Real x2}

2004-07-21  Jorge S. Pérez <josp@tol-project.org>

	* generic/tolsergrp.cpp:
	- that pointer should be set to 0 at construction.

	that bug was driving me crazy!

	* generic/tolaccess.cpp:
	solving http://bugs.tol-project.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=83

	instead of checking for if ARG_INDEXES 'IsShared' we should only care about
	last_index (the only object in the list we modify)

2004-04-29  Jorge S. Pérez <josp@tol-project.org>

	* generic/toltime.cpp:
	Tol_CreateTMSCmd now use Tol_ResolveObject to find the referenced tol object

2004-04-23  Daniel Rus <danirus@tol-project.org>
