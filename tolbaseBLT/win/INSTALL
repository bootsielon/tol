tolbase -  Compiling under Windows platform

This file what is needed to compile tolbase under windows
platform. The source code has being prepared to be compiled with
Microsoft VC++ version 6. A project file tolbase.dsp is provided to
generate de executable tolbase.exe.

Software requirement
====================

In order to create tolbase.exe we must to link against the Tcl/Tk
libraries. tolbase also depends on this Tcl/Tk extension in runtime:
BLT (2.4z), BWidget (1.7), snit (0.91), tclodbc, TkTable and toltcl.
All this extensions, but toltcl, can be obtained from
http://www.tol-project.org/downloads/tolbase_addons.zip. The contents
of this file must be unpacked and copied to the tolbase's directory
lib.

Normally we must copy the last compilation of toltcl.dll to the
location lib/toltcl/toltcl.dll.

Environment variables
=====================

Libraries and header files dependencies of tolbase are solved with the
environment variables TCL_INCLUDE, TCL_LIB. TCL_INCLUDE points to the
location of Tcl include files, TCL_LIB points to the location of Tcl
libraries (.lib). For instance, if Tcl/Tk was installed in "c:\tcltk"
then the values for those variables could be:

TCL_INCLUDE = c:\tcltk\include

TCL_LIB = c:\tcltk\lib

Runtime requirement
===================

Below is a graph of dependencies for tolbase (there are others but
those are solved using the tcl's package mechanism). In order to solve
the dependencies wrt. tol.dll, gsl.dll and gslcblas.dll this must be
found either in the search path of windows (PATH environment variable)
or located in the same place of tolbase.exe. This last is the one we
use to distribute tolbase.
