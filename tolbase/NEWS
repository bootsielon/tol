* What is new in TolBase-1.1.3

** Progressbar

   A progressbar file (_progressbar.tol) with a dialog was added to provide Tol Code 
   programmers the capability to display a progress bar for the large time waiting 
   process.

** Graph Functions & TolMethods

   New interface was created to allow users to graph by means of calling functions.
   Allowed graphics:
       - series.   (with TclChartSerie  function)
       - sets.     (with TclChartSet    function)
       - matrices. (with TclChartMatrix function) 

   In all of those functions the "title" option was modified to allow this property
   as title of graph and window.

** Global variables

   Normalized the value of 'dir' to obtain the full path.

** Tabulate Functions

   Added functions to tabulate a tol Set and tol Serie.
       - Tol_SetTabulate
       - Tol_SerieTabulate

** MDI
 
   New options in mdi forms
       - backimg   -> to specify a background image. 
       - resizable -> controls when user can or cannot resize the window.

** BD Connection
   
   New option added
       - autoconnect -> "1" or "0" (default) to connect automatically with Data Base.

** Functions Search

   The form was changed to a document instead of a dialog.
   The elements of the form has been reordered.
   Search allows not case sensitive.
   The results of the search it's show by means of blisboxplus
   Search functions are included in proyect
   If it's possible, allows to visualize the function within the file

** TolBase Options

   New option was added in this subject: 
   - "program paths" tab in TolBase options dialog. Allows to specify paths for:
          - browser 
          - PDFViewer 

      Those programs will be used to view help, data and so on.


* What is new in TolBase-1.1.2

** MDI

   Modified the visualization format of the windows and forms of TolBase to
   perform an MDI environment.
   A principal (or container) window exists and all the forms will be located
   in this area.

** ToolBar Main

   Added button bar in the main form.

** Status Main

   Added status bar in the main form, inncluding text info and a small clock.

** Multiple projects

   The load of different projects or modules is allowed. The project
   specification is read from "tolbase/lib/toltk/project.ini".
   The project.ini file has now a different structure:
   [Project]      # Required and required to be first
   title=         # title of the main window, can be left empty (Uses TOLBase
                  # by default)
   splash=        # Full path to splash image to use, can be left empty (Uses
                  # the image in $toltklibrary/toltk/images/splash.gif by default)
   [PrjName1]
   name=          # Project's namespace
   path=          # Project file paths, there must be a tcl dir within
                  # and a file named name.tcl with a name::name function
                  # this function is the one which tolbase will load
                  # from here on user must load the rest of files for the project
   [PrjName2]
   ...

** GUI functions

   It is possible to apply functions to any TOL variable from the object
   inspector. This can be defined in the global set "GuiFunction". Examples can
   be found in _guifunction.tol at tolInitLib. Those calls are saved in _eval.tol

** Eval window

   The evaluation window has a Syntax Check command now.
   Now it is also possible checking or evaluating just the selected text.

** File editor

   Added the possibility of compiling a file without saving it. If any text
   is selected it is evaluated(in the eval window), otherwise file is
   included, but not compiled. It is very useful!
   Only one editor of the same TOL file can be opened.
   Syntax Check can be done now only for selected text.

** Project Editor

   Bound some actions: Compile (F9), Decompile (F8), Insert Node (Ins),
   Delete Node (Del), View Node Attributes (Space) and Open Node (Return).
   Node paths are stored relative to project's one in case it belongs to
   the same unit as the project base directory, otherwise the full path
   will be used.
   When adding a node it searches from the last opened node directory or the
   project base directory.
   Nodes can be inserted instead of appended. Do this by selecting "Add node".

** SQL Editor

   Added some reserved words for SQL and SQL Server functions.
   When text window contains a selected text only the selection is executed,
   else all text of eval window is executed.

** Parameters TolBase

   Command line arguments are now parsed:

     .tol, .bdt, .bst, .bmt, .prj files along with:

     -i : Includes the file associate
          Example: tolbase.exe -i test.tol
     -r : Compiles the file associate
          Example: tolbase.exe -r test.tol
     -b : Opens TolBase, it executes sentences indicated and it closes TolBase
          Example: tolbase.exe -b -i table.bst -r test.tol

** Graph

   Added an option to self-fit an opening graph.
   "Jump to first data", "Jump to last data", "Play backwards" and
   "Play forward" options modified to work correctly within the 4 axis.

** Autocorrelation graphs:

   "Lags" and "Sigmas" options apply only to active graph. Before this fix,
   they were applied to all graphs.
