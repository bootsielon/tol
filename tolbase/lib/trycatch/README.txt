Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To use trycatch, you need to have Tcl installed on your system.
It was written using Tcl 8.3.1, but probably works OK for any
version that supports packages and namespaces.

trycatch is a standard Tcl package.  Either create a "trycatch"
directory in your standard tcl/lib directory, or add the trycatch
directory to your TCLLIBPATH in the usual way.
